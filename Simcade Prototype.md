# Digital Prototype Development - Fire Game
## Overview 
You are a pirate ship in the middle of the ocean sailing around islands and defending yourself from other ships.

### Objective Statement


### Design Rationale / Mechanics
Your ship, a small ship in the middle of the ocean, has enemy ships surrounding it where they come in waves/rounds and attacking. When you beat one wave, the next wave will come in, but the attack is even harder. 

If you survive the attack of two (2) waves of ships, you will receive an extra life or full health. 

Points counter for when you destroy enemy ships 

You control the ship (Ship is the player). You are not controlling a player on the ship. ​

### Metric Research and References
Physics elements:  

Cannon - (A cannon mounted on a pirate ship fires a cannonball at 125 m/s horizontally, at a height of 17.5 m above the ocean surface. 

Fire  

Water – tutorial - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL_zHQEju8s 

Metric force Units - measured in newtons (N), defined as the force needed to accelerate 1 kilogram of mass by 1 meter per second squared (1 N = 1 kg·m/s²). 

### Play Test Feedback 

Below are three questions we asked the group who play-tested our game to respond to, followed by their answers. 

Questions:
1) Did the cannons feel like they were moving and shooting correctly?
    
3) Does the water movement add to the experience, and did it feel like sailing
   
5) Do you think waves of enemies that are easy to take out would be better, or just one enemy that is difficult to take out?

1) The cannons felt like they shot correctly, they felt good to shoot. but the key bind was very awkward. For raising and lowering it I'd say either Q & E or Up and Down arrows would be better.  

2) The water movement adds to the experience, but making the initial acceleration a little faster so when you add enemies you have time to escape would be beneficial  

3) I think a horde mode would be the cooler of the two if I had to pick one

1) The cannons were moving and shooting correctly and worked as intended! my only concern would be is at first i didn't know what the z/x controls changed the angle of since the camera is a bit far from the boat & the cannons appeared to be tiny so i couldn't tell at first  

2) The water definitely added to the experience! I loved how you guys added this realistic aspect to the game of the waves moving  

3) I think it would be interesting to take out one difficult enemy with a comically large health bar lol
